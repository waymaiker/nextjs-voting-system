# Voting system

Alyra course project - phase 3

A small organization has decided, to use a new vote system.  
All voters are known to the organization and are whitelisted using their Ethereum address.   
They can submit new proposals during a proposal registration session and can vote on proposals only during the voting session.  
When the administrator has tallied the votes, the vote is closed.

Few rules:  
✔️ Voting is not secret for users added to the Whitelist.  
✔️ Each voter can see the votes of others.  
✔️ The winner is determined by simple majority.  
✔️ The proposal that gets the most votes wins.
